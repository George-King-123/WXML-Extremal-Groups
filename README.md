# Dependencies 
You should have numpy, pandas, and tqdm installed. 

# How to run this code

- Each file has instructions for how it should be run. The instructions always state to run `python -m <dotted module name>` in the terminal. The terminal should be opened in the root directory of this project, i.e. where this README is located. 
    - If you run the code in a different way, you may get import errors

- The `main()` function in each relevant file have commented out commands which may be of interest. Files without `main()` functions just have utilities.
